# wide.exe
a dumb program made by me to test out GDI+ and other win32 things

thanks to [pankoza-pl](https://github.com/pankoza-pl) for [some of the code](https://github.com/pankoza-pl/gdithings/blob/main/wide.cpp)

this is NOT malware. it's just simply a program that stretches your screen indefinitely for a dead meme and was made just for a bit of fun and just to practice how good my C++ skills are (spoiler: it's bad)
